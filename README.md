# iosevka_lite
This is a very light subset of the [Iosevka](https://github.com/be5invis/Iosevka) font by [Renzhi Li](https://typeof.net/).

## Modifications
I modified the font based off the `v31.2.0` release to only contain the basic latin (`U+0000...U+007F`) and latin-1 supplement (`U+0080...U+00FF`) unicode ranges. This was done to minimize file size as much as possible for use in my website.

## License
I have preserved the original SIL OFL v1.1 license, refer to [LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md).
